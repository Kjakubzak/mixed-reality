A button has long been a metaphor used for triggering an event in the 2D abstract world. In the three-dimensional mixed reality world, we don’t have to be confined to this world of abstraction anymore. Anything can be an **interactable object** that triggers an event. An interactable object can be represented as anything from a coffee cup on the table to a balloon floating in the air. We still do make use of traditional buttons in certain situation such as in dialog UI. The visual representation of the button depends on the context.

## Creating interactable object with Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)

In the **[Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)**, you can find the series of Unity scripts and prefabs that will help you create interactable objects. You can use these to make objects respond to various types of input interaction states.

* [Interactable](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_Interactable.html)
* [Button](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_Button.html)
* [Hand interaction examples scene](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/mrtk_release/Documentation/README_HandInteractionExamples.md)

MixedRealityToolkit's Standard shader provides various options such as **proximity light** that helps you create visual and audio cues.
